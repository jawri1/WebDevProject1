<title>Okay, this is what I did about my Finances</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> The problem: I was not keeping a record of any of my spending/expenses or income and I couldnt find a free budget binder i liked online. 
<center><br><em>So I created my own,</br> <br>see below;</em></h1></br></center>


<br><a href="C:\Users\Jada\Desktop\Personal monthly budget spreadsheet1.xlsx">Budgeting Book</a</br>

<p1>I also decided I needed to attempt to cut back a bit. I started listing what expenses could I eliminate or lower the monthly payment on? 
What  debts could I payoff quickly? I bought a ledger book first (thats how my Grandmother balances her books and I learned a lot from her) 
but I used maybe 7 pages of it. Its currently collecting dust in my basement, on a desk I rarely visit. I printed some I found online, but
they didnt get as in depth as I needed.</p1>

<p2>I liked seeing each account and its history, it gave me a visual of the account history and past balances. I had been robbing peter to pay
paul every so often and I needed to keep an accurate log of due dates, paid dates, payment amounts, principle balances, etc., just to keep
things somewhat organized. </p2>

<p3>Just because it works for me does not mean it will work for you, my goal was to keep a handwritten log of each time is spent money, no 
matter what the money was for, for 30 days. I knew I would want to color code and track the data to show exactly how much of my money was
going where. And Boy did reveal a lot!</p3>

<p4>It showed me exactly where i needed to improve, so I worked on those things and after another 30 days of tracking, the improvements showed.</p4>
